# Test-Driven Development

When applicable, follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. **Red**: Write failing tests defining expected behavior
2. **Green**: Minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor**: Clean up while tests stay green

Use for: new features, bug fixes (reproduce first), API contracts, complex logic.
