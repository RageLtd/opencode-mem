# Biome (CRITICAL)

Always run Biome against supported file types when finishing work.

## Supported File Types

JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, TSX, JSON, CSS, and GraphQL.

## Commands

```
biome check --write .
```

This runs both formatting and linting with auto-fix in a single pass.

## Installation

If Biome is not already a project dev-dependency, suggest installing it:

```
bun add --dev @biomejs/biome
```
