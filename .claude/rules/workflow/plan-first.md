# Plan First

Present plan, wait for approval, then execute. No silent action.

- Approvals are per-message and don't carry over
- Re-plan when scope changes
- Use read/exploration before destructive actions
- Max 2 clarifying questions, then proceed with stated assumptions

## Standard Flow

```
Plan → Present → Approval → Execute → Update Todos
```
