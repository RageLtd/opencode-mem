# Functional Programming Style (CRITICAL)

Always use functional programming. Do not introduce classes, inheritance, or mutable state without explicit approval.

- Pure functions and immutable data are the default — no exceptions
- Use composition over inheritance
- Use declarative patterns over imperative ones
- If an OOP approach seems necessary, stop and ask before proceeding
