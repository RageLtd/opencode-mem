# Security and Safety

- **Secrets/PII**: Never include in outputs, redact in examples
- **Sensitive files**: Ask before reading `.env`, credentials, or config files
- **Destructive actions**: Require explicit approval with impact assessment
- **No silent workarounds**: Stop and report when blocked — never proceed without approval
